- We made large changes to our infrastructure to be more reliable and faster. 
  This means faster deployment, less downtime and roughly half the inference time!

## 0.2.4
<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Date: 23 November 2022</p>
- Add more models to our Prebuilt library
- mt0-xl
- galactica
- flan-xl

## 0.2.3
<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Date: 11 November 2022</p>
- Added support for post-processing functions in flows!
- Add Prebuilt models to available deployments
- whisper-medium


## 0.2.2
<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">28 October 2022</p>
- Fix a bug where the internal flow would be malformed if the model was not
  ONNX
- Force single model ONNX flow until post-processing is supported

## 0.2.1
<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Date: 26 October 2022</p>
- Support for ONNX models with Python 3.7-3.9 (can be used as a single model or
  as the initial model of a flow). We are working on supporting Python 3.10
  and 3.11!

## v0.2.0
<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Date: 23 October 2022</p>
- Model ensembles are here! You can now deploy a sequence of models to an
  endpoint and have them run in order.
- Change the deploy call signature to accommodate for model ensembles.
- Added explicit model types to be used in place of the previous plain strings.

## v0.1.9
<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Date: 18 October 2022</p>
- Reduce minimum python version to 3.7 (and reduce dependency min versions
  accordingly). Now compatible with Google Colab!

## v0.1.5
<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Date: 17 October 2022</p>
- Update license
- Handle usage limits on different Cerebrium packages

## v0.1.4
<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Date: 16 October 2022</p>

- Support for Torchscript models
- Support for XGB JSON models

## v0.1.2
<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Date: 7th October 2022</p>
- Moved architecture to serverless CPU/GPU's

- Bug fixes and performance improvements

## V0.1.1
<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Date: 26th September 2022</p>
- Released alpha version of Neuron.
- Users are able to deploy models from their notebooks or .py files with just 4
